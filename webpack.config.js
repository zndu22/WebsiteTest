 * Webpack config  -  this is not currently used, but is here as

 * Note that to use this config, you'll need to put a suitable `index.html` file
 * in the build directory, with <script> tags for `bundle.js` and `babylon.js`.
 *
 *  
 * Then to build:
 *      npm i webpack webpack-cli
 *      cd src/hello-world
 *      webpack --env prod
